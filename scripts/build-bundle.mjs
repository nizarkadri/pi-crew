/**
 * 5.5 — Bundle pi-crew into a single ESM file using esbuild.
 *
 * Output:
 *   dist/index.mjs        — bundled extension entrypoint
 *   dist/index.mjs.map    — source map
 *
 * Pi peer dependencies are kept external. Bundling shrinks parse+module-
 * resolution cost on cold start: with strip-types Node still has to parse
 * each .ts file individually, so a single .mjs cuts the per-file overhead.
 *
 * This script is invoked by `npm run build:bundle`. The `package.json#exports`
 * field is configured so:
 *   - `dist/index.mjs` is the preferred entrypoint when present (set by Pi
 *     extension loader via "pi.extensions").
 *   - `index.ts` remains the fallback when dist/ is missing (e.g. running
 *     directly out of a clone without prior build).
