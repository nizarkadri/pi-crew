# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **pi-crew** repository — a Pi extension for multi-agent team orchestration. It coordinates autonomous AI agent teams with durable state, parallel execution, worktree isolation, and safe defaults.

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Design

```
Pi extension layer
  register tools, slash commands, widget/dashboard, notifier, lifecycle cleanup

Runtime layer
  team runner, task graph scheduler, child Pi process runner, async runner,
  model fallback, policy engine, worktree manager

State layer
  <crewRoot>/state/runs/{runId}/manifest.json
  <crewRoot>/state/runs/{runId}/tasks.json
  <crewRoot>/state/runs/{runId}/events.jsonl
  <crewRoot>/artifacts/{runId}/...
```

`crewRoot` resolves to `.crew/` (default) or `.pi/teams/` (legacy repos).

### Key Source Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/extension/team-tool.ts` | Main tool — 28 actions (run, status, list, recommend, doctor, config, etc.) |
| `src/runtime/team-runner.ts` | Workflow scheduler, task graph, concurrency control |
| `src/runtime/task-runner.ts` | Task execution, workspace/worktree context, model selection |
| `src/runtime/child-pi.ts` | Child Pi process runner — spawns real `pi` workers |
| `src/runtime/async-runner.ts` | Detached background run spawner |
| `src/state/` | Durable state/event/artifact store |
| `src/worktree/` | Worktree creation and cleanup |
| `src/config/` | Runtime config, resource discovery |
| `agents/`, `teams/`, `workflows/` | Builtin resources |

### Tool Actions (28 total)

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `recommend` | Suggest team/workflow for a goal |
| `run` | Execute workflow (foreground or async) |
| `plan` | Preview workflow without executing |
| `status` | Read run/task status |
| `summary` | Read/write run summary artifact |
| `cancel` | Cancel queued/running work |
| `resume` | Re-queue failed/cancelled/skipped tasks |
| `list` | List teams, agents, workflows, runs |
| `get` | Inspect resource details |
| `events` | Read event log (append-only) |
| `artifacts` | List run output artifacts |
| `worktrees` | List run worktree metadata |
| `cleanup` | Delete run worktrees |
| `forget` | Delete run state + artifacts |
| `prune` | Delete multiple old finished runs |
| `export` | Export portable run bundle |
| `import` / `imports` | Import/store run bundles |
| `create` / `update` / `delete` | Manage agents/teams/workflows |
| `validate` | Validate resources |
| `doctor` | Environment diagnostics |
| `config` | Show/update configuration |
| `init` | Initialize project layout |
| `autonomy` | Delegation policy management |
| `api` | State interop for advanced integration |
| `help` | Display help text |

### Runtime Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `child-process` (default) | Spawn real `pi` child processes for task execution |
| `scaffold` | Dry-run mode — preview prompts without executing |
| `live-session` (experimental) | In-process session-based execution |

### State Layout

```
<crewRoot>/                          # .crew/ (default) or .pi/teams/ (legacy)
├── state/runs/{runId}/
│   ├── manifest.json                # Run metadata + config
│   ├── tasks.json                   # Task graph + status
│   ├── events.jsonl                 # Append-only events
│   └── agents/{taskId}/status.json  # Per-agent state
├── artifacts/{runId}/
│   ├── goal.md                      # Original goal
│   ├── prompts/{taskId}.md         # Rendered task prompts
│   ├── results/{taskId}.txt        # Task results
│   ├── logs/{taskId}.log           # Execution logs
│   └── summary.md                   # Run summary
├── worktrees/{runId}/{taskId}/     # Isolated git worktrees
└── imports/{runId}/run-export.json
```

### Built-in Teams

- `default` — explore → plan → execute → verify
- `fast-fix` — explore → execute → verify (bug fixes)
- `implementation` — adaptive planner fanout for multi-file work
- `review` — explore → code-review → security-review → verify
- `research` — explore → analyze → write

### Resource Discovery (precedence)

```
builtin (package) < user (~/.pi/agent/) < project (.crew/ or .pi/teams/)
```

Custom agents/teams/workflows are YAML files with routing metadata (triggers, useWhen, avoidWhen, cost, category).

## Common Commands

```bash
# TypeScript validation
npm run typecheck

# Lazy import check
npm run check:lazy-imports

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only (fast, parallel)
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests only (sequential, slow)
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode for unit tests
npm run test:watch

# Full CI pipeline
npm run ci

# Run a single test file
node --experimental-strip-types --test --test-concurrency=1 --test-timeout=120000 test/unit/your-test.test.ts

# Smoke test local pi install
npm run smoke:pi
```

## Development Notes

### Source of Truth Order

Read in this order when changing behavior:
1. `AGENTS.md` — operating rules and paths
2. `docs/HARNESS.md` — human-agent collaboration model
3. `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` — before turning any request into work
4. `docs/architecture.md` — implementation shape
5. `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` — proof status

### Task Loop

1. Classify the request with `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`
2. Identify affected modules and risk level
3. Choose lane: tiny, normal, or high-risk
4. Implement the change
5. Run validation: `npm test` + `npm run typecheck`
6. Update docs, stories, test matrix, decisions as needed
7. Report what changed and what was not attempted
