# Test Matrix

Maps pi-crew behavior to proof. Every row must have real validation evidence.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| planned | Accepted behavior, not implemented |
| in_progress | Actively being built |
| implemented | Implemented and proof exists |
| changed | Contract changed after implementation |
| retired | No longer part of product |

## Evidence Rules

- **Unit proof**: Pure logic, state transitions, config parsing
- **Integration proof**: Multi-module interaction (team runner → state → child process)
- **CI proof**: Cross-platform (ubuntu, windows, macos) green on GitHub Actions
- A story can be implemented without every proof column if the story explains why
- Agents must run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before claiming done

## Validation Commands

```bash
npm test                    # Run all unit tests (1655 tests across 268 unit files + 14 integration files)
npm run typecheck           # TypeScript check + strip-types import
npm run check               # Biome lint + format
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests only (fast, parallel)
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests only (sequential)
gh run list --limit 1       # Check latest CI status
```
